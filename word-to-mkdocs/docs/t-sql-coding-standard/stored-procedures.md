# Stored procedures

You **SHOULD: -**

-   **Use meaningful names to indicate the purpose of procedures &
    parameters. Be verbose if needed.**

-   **Match parameter datatypes to the underlying data to avoid implicit
    conversion.**

-   **Include a comment header to indicate the procedure's purpose and
    use. Include an example call if possible.**

-   **Enclose procedures with** BEGIN END **blocks after the** AS
    **keyword.** 

-   Add the SET NOCOUNT ON statement before any Data Manipulation
    Language statements unless you have good reason for not doing so.
    

-   **Use** SET XACT_ABORT ON**. It terminates and rollbacks the entire
    transaction when a T-SQL statement raises a run-time error.**

-   **Declare variables, table variables and temp tables at the start of
    a procedure**[^8]**.**

-   **Use** BEGIN **and** END **after** IF**, even if only one statement
    is covered. This makes the code clearer and avoids errors if further
    statements are added to the** IF **block later.**

-   **Use table variables for transitory tables with *less* than 1000
    rows.** 

-   **Use temporary tables for transitory tables with *more* than 1000
    rows.** 

-   Use **explicit transactions when updating data.**

-   **Use SavePoints within a transaction. The use of SavePoint can
    allow you to rollback a series of statements within a transaction.**

-   Pass parameters explicitly to Stored Procedures and EXECUTE
    statements wherever possible**.**
    

You **SHOULD NOT: -**

-   **Set the** ANSI_NULLS **option. It should normally be set to ON and
    is deprecated by Microsoft and not supported for certain indexes.**
    

-   **Set the** QUOTED_IDENTIFIER **option. It has no effect and should
    normally be set to ON.**
    

-   Declare **variables** you never use.
    

-   Use CURSOR *s* and WHILE clauses.

-   Use Table Variables, Temporary Tables, Common Table Expressions and
    Subqueries without understanding their impact on performance.

-   **Use nested transactions. A** ROLLBACK **of a nested transaction
    can affect more than just the statements executed.**

-   **Return multiple result sets.**

-   **Supply stored procedures with a wide range of data parameters. SQL
    Server compiles these to a single query plan.**
