# Date and time

**You **SHOULD**: -**

-   Use a suitable date / time datatype. Their precision differs and
    affects the performance of your queries accordingly.

-   Express dates in ISO format to remove ambiguity. For example,
    12/04/2017 may be interpreted as 12^th^ April or 4^th^ December
    depending on your configuration.

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    Use year, month day yyyymmdd format for a date alone (e.g., 20171204)

    Use year, month, day and time format yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.xxx for a date & time (e.g. 2017-12-04T14:24:30.123)

-   **Cast** DATETIME **or** SMALLDATETIME **fields to** DATE **if
    you're interested only in the date part. SQL Server supports this.**

**You **SHOULD NOT**:-**

-   Use DATEDIFF when searching date ranges. As with other functions,
    this prevents the database engine making use of any indexes.

-   Use BETWEEN for searching datetime ranges. The start and end of the
    range can appear ambiguous. Use the operators \>*,* \<*,* \>=*,*
    \<=*,* = instead.

-   Use the *+* or *--* operators on date/time fields; It is unclear
    what unit is being applied. For example, it's not clear that
    GETDATE()+1) will return this time tomorrow. Newer datatypes such as
    DATE, DATETIME2 and DATETIMEOFFSET throw errors when used in this
    way.
