# Top (n) and order by

**You SHOULD** try to order result sets in the application layer.
Because qualifying statements with ORDER BY are expensive in SQL!

**You **SHOULD NOT**: -**

-   **Use** SET ROWCOUNT**. Prefer the** TOP(N) **syntax of the** SELECT
    **statement.** 

-   U**se** TOP **in a** SELECT **list without using** ORDER BY
     It's clear and returns consistent
    results.

-   U**se constants in an** ORDER BY **clause; It's deprecated and makes
    code hard to
    read.**
