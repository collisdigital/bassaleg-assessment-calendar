# 5.15 working with user defined functions (udf)

You **SHOULD:-**

-   **Use inline table valued functions instead of scalar functions
    where possible.**

-   **Use** WITH SCHEMABINDING **for non-data accessing scalar user
    defined functions. It forces SQL server to check data access is
    occurring at design time. Thus, preventing the need to do so during
    execution.**

You **SHOULD NOT: -**

-   **Use multi-statement table valued functions; these can impede
    performance**.

-   **Use side-effecting operators within a user defined function, for
    example** SELECT**,** PRINT**,** INSERT**,** UPDATE**,** TRY**,**
    CATCH
