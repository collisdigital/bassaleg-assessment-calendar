2.  Open SQL Server Management Studio with Redgate SQL Prompt v9 or
    later installed and choose ***SQL Prompt*\>*Options.***

### The settings file explained

## 8.2 SQL prompt formatting style file

### How to import the style

1.  Download the *NWIS_STANDARD_SQLPROMPT_SETTINGS* file to a local
    directory.

> You can find the file from the *Software Development Standards* git
> repo under the *Software Development Standards* project on Application
> Development & Support's Azure DevOps instance.

2.  You have a choice of two versions. If using SQL Prompt v10.5 or
    later, choose the newer *.json* file extension. If using an earlier
    version, choose the *.sqlpromptstylev2* file type.

3.  With the correct style file selected, save it to "*\<Insert Drive
    Letter\>*:\\*Users*\\*\<Insert Test-Dev-NADEX-ID\>*
    *AppData\\Local\\Red Gate\\SQL Prompt \<Version\>\\StylesV2" or*
    "*\<Insert Drive Letter\>*:\\*Users*\\*\<Insert Test-Dev-NADEX-ID\>*
    *AppData\\Local\\Red Gate\\SQL Prompt \<Version\>\\Styles* [^16]

4.  Open SQL Server Management Studio with Redgate SQL Prompt v9 or
    later installed.

5.  From the menu choose ***SQL Prompt*\>*Active Styles\>Edit Formatting
    Styles***

6.  Under ***Your styles*** (top right), select the vertical ellipsis
    next to ***NWIS_Custom style indented, commas before*** and choose
    ***Set as active.***

**The style file explained**

Uses Redgate's ***Indented defaults*** as its base style with the
following customisations applied: -

| **GLOBAL** |  |
| --- | --- |
| - Whitespace | ***Wrapping*** > Sets ***Wrap lines longer than*** to *[160 > characters]* |
| - Lists | ***Commas*** > Checks ***Place commas before items*** > > Sets ***Comma alignment*** to *[Before > item]* > > Checks ***Add a space after comma*** |
| - Casing | > Sets ***Global variables*** to > *[UPPERCASE]* |
| **EXPRESSIONS** |  |
| - CASE | Unchecks ***Place expressions on new line*** ***WHEN*** > Sets ***Place first WHEN on new line*** to > *[If there's an input > expression]* > > Sets ***WHEN alignment*** to *[Indented from > CASE]* **THEN expressions** > Unchecks ***Place THEN on new line*** **ELSE** > Checks ***Place ELSE on new line*** > > Checks ***Align ELSE to WHEN*** **END** > Checks ***Place END on new line*** > > Sets ***End alignment*** to *To CASE* **Short CASE expressions** > Unchecks ***Collapse CASE expressions > shorter than n characters*** |

### Notes & explanation

Commas before: -

-   clearly define a new column.

-   help identify when a comma is missing.

-   make it easier to comment out additional fields during development.

Indentation aids readability. However, long expressions may appear
distorted when wrapped. See the section [Exceptions prove the
rule](#_EXCEPTIONS_PROVE_THE).
