# Aliases

You **SHOULD:-**

-   Alias *ALL* table names using the convention AS *\<alias\>*.
    

-   **Use meaningful** alias names, following our naming conventions
    (see later in this document.)

-   **Qualify each column with the parent table or alias, especially
    where the parent table is part of a join or subquery.**
