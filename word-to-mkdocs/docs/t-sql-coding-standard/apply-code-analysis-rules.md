# Apply code analysis rules

You **SHOULD**: -

-   Specify column names when using INSERT, even when inserting data
    into all columns.
    

-   Expand the asterisk wildcard to explicitly define all columns.
    

-   Qualify object names. Prefix each reference to a table with its
    schema (but not the database name) and each column to its parent
    table (or alias) in SELECT statements.
    

-   Terminate all statements with a semi-colon and with no leading
    whitespace. 

-   Favour EXISTS or table joins over IN or COUNT where it's sensible to
    do so. 

-   **Include an** ELSE **block with each** CASE expression.
    

-   Prefer the use of SCOPE_IDENTITY() to @@IDENTITY.
    

-   Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) instead of non-correlated
    subqueries. A CTE is easier to read than a subquery and offers the
    same performance.

-   Use functions like ISNULL**,** IS NULL**,** ISNUMERIC**,**
    TRY_CONVERT**,** COALESCE **and** CAST **correctly.**

**You **SHOULD NOT**:-**

-   Use INSERT INTO ***\<table\>* with an** ORDER BY **clause. The order
    depends on the clustered index if one is
    defined.**

-   **Use** DELETE **without a** WHERE **or** INNER JOIN clause
    

-   **Use** UPDATE **without a** WHERE **or** INNER JOIN clause
    

-   Use correlated sub-queries. (The exception to this is the use of
    EXISTS.)

-   **Define** JOIN **conditions in the** WHERE **clause.** Include the
    JOIN condition in the ON clause.
    

-   **Include** WHERE **clauses in** SELECT **statements**[^3] **to
    prevent defining Cartesian joins.**

-   **Use** ISNULL **in a** WHERE **or** JOIN **clause. Expressions need
    to use** IS \[NOT\] NULL **and the** COALESCE **function to handle**
    NULL **values appropriately.**
    

-   **Use comparison operators against a** NULL **value.**
    

-   **Use** DISTINCT where it is not required. Use a GROUP BY clause
    where possible and check JOIN conditions to eliminate duplicate
    rows.

-   Use wildcards (such as %) at the start of LIKE in WHERE clauses.
    Indexes *cannot* support wildcard queries at the start of a LIKE
    expression.

-   **Reference columns that do not have indexes in a** WHERE**,** JOIN
    **or** ORDER BY **clause.**

-   **Use system or user-defined scalar functions in a** WHERE **or**
    JOIN **clause. Functions are evaluated for each row in the result
    set. Any indexes cannot be used on the column the function is being
    performed on.**

-   Use the NOLOCK hint. It's safer to specify the correct isolation
    level instead.
