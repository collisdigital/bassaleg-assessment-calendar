# Handling exceptions

You **SHOULD: -**

-   Manage exceptions in each stored procedure, but you **SHOULD NOT**
    mask the error from the calling application.

-   Use the TRY \... CATCH construct to handle errors in T-SQL.

-   **Use a log table to record errors handled. It helps with support
    and maintenance.**

-   Favour THROW over RAISERROR wherever possible (i.e. in database
    compatibility SQL 2012 and later.)

-   Return a result code.
