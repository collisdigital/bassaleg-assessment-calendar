# Follow out table design rules: schemes and indexes

You **SHOULD**: -

-   Specify a schema when creating a table from a script.

-   Ensure that each Primary Key comprises the column(s) that uniquely
    identify each row in the table.

-   Include the index type (clustered or non-clustered) when defining
    the Primary Key.
    

-   Choose the most suitable column(s) for a clustered index[^1].

-   Use the Primary Key as the clustered index (it's the default and
    usually the prime candidate but not always!)

-   Include the table name and the indexed fields (ordered as specified
    in the index definition) in the index name.

-   **Use the** INCLUDE **clause of non-clustered indexes to cover
    columns returned in select clauses or used to join other tables.
    This prevents the query optimizer having to perform key-lookup
    operations.**

-   **Learn how the index column order in a multi-column index affects
    performance.**

-   **Define any necessary Foreign Key constraints on your tables.**

-   Include the table name, referenced field(s) and referencing field(s)
    in the Foreign Key name.

-   **Create an index on a foreign key's child table columns.**

-   **Review index reports**[^2] **with your support team. Remember that
    in high availability environments, such as an *Always On
    Availability Group*, the index usage is different on writable and
    read-only nodes.**

**You **SHOULD NOT**: -**

-   Create tables without defining a Primary Key or Clustered Index.

-   Use GUIDs (e.g. UNIQUEIDENTIFIER) for clustered keys, especially
    where the primary key is defined as the clustered index. This can
    result in performance problems. Rather use an alternative datatype,
    for example BIGINT, or use the function NEWSEQUENTIALID()to generate
    a GUID. This reduces fragmentation.

-   Use a column that is frequently updated in a clustered index.

-   **Create duplicate indexes. Remember, column order in the** INCLUDE
    **clause is *not* significant.**

    In 2015, a database reference table allowing duplicates contributed to the problem of missing electronic microbiology results.
