# Follow our code layout rules

These rules apply to decorative changes that affect whitespace such as
tabs, spaces and line breaks. Nonetheless, it's important to adhere to a
standard, to help others understand the intent of code.

So, while SQL Prompt allows us to write code in a format, we find
comfortable, we must always apply our standard styling rules[^14] before
sharing code and checking it into source control.

You **SHOULD format and analyse your code using SQL Prompt before
checking into source control.**

You **SHOULD configure SQL Prompt with our rule. See** [SQL Prompt
configuration](#_SQL_Prompt_configuration) **for help with using our
standard SQL Prompt config files.**
