# Configuring agents for Azure pipelines

Agents execute tasks in an Azure Pipeline and are available in two
types:

-   **Self-Hosted Agents**: Managed on your infrastructure.

-   **Microsoft-Hosted Agents**: Fully managed by Microsoft and
    available on demand.

## Choose an agent type

Choosing the right agent type depends on your needs-- see below.

| **COMPONENT** | **SELF-HOSTED** | **MICROSOFT-HOSTED** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **COST** | Pay for VMs; build minutes/parallel jobs covered by Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions. | Pay per minute beyond free-tier usage. |
| **MANAGEMENT** | Manual setup and maintenance required. | Fully managed; no setup needed. |
| * *FLEXIBILITY** | Full control over tools and network configuration. | Preconfigured environments; limited customisation. |
| * *SCALABILITY** | Limited by VM capacity and no. of available Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions. | Scales on demand; no infrastructure limits. |
| ** AVAILABILITY** | Restricted to DevTest VM uptime: Mon--Fri: 7 PM--7 AM. Sat & Sun: Unavailable. | Available without downtime. |

## Our recommendation

Use **Self-Hosted Agents** for cost-effective scaling with multiple
parallel jobs under our Visual Studio agreement.

Use **Microsoft-Hosted Agents** for occasional tasks or to avoid
management overheads and VM costs.

## Setting up a self-hosted agent

To configure a self-hosted agent:

-   Provision an Azure Virtual Machine.

-   Add the agent to an existing pool (create a new pool if needed).

-   Install and configure the agent software from Azure DevOps.

-   Run the agent as a service for automatic restarts.

## Securing a self-hosted agent

To ensure agent security:

-   Use separate pools for different projects to reduce risk.

-   Assign a dedicated pool for production deployments.

-   Restrict access to the agent folder to authorised personnel.

-   Clean temporary files in the agent's build folder regularly.

-   Keep the agent software updated.

-   Run the agent under a service account (e.g., Network Service or
    Local Service).

-   Avoid using admin or high-privilege accounts.

## Recommended naming conventions

Use clear, descriptive names for agents and pools to improve
readability.

| **COMPONENT** | **NAMING CONVENTION** | **example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AGENT** | \<team or project name\>-\<agent type\> | wis-api-self-hosted, welshpas-web-ms-hosted |
| **AGENT POOL** | \<team or project name\>-\<purpose\> | wis-api-build, welshpas-web-deploy |

    When using [GitHub Advanced Security](enabling-github-advanced-security.md) allow additional URLs for the self-hosted agent to access data for *Dependency Scanning*.
