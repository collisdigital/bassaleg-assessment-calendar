# Adding users and Teams

## Add users

When adding users, you **MUST** grant only the minimum access level
necessary. Use built-in [security groups](azure-devops-basics.md) for
easier management, avoiding broad groups unless essential.

## Add additional Teams

Each project has a default team, "*\<Project Name\>* Team". You can add
teams for specific areas or products, each with its own backlogs,
sprints, and dashboards.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    When creating a team, use a clear, descriptive name that reflects its focus (e.g. feature or product), Avoid generic terms like *"Developers".*

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    **Phoenix Portal Team:** Front-end UI and integration with back-end APIs.

    **Titan Mobile Team:** Mobile app and integration with back-end APIs.

    **Atlas Immunisations API Team:** Backend Immunisation APIs.

    **Helios Appointments Team**: Immunisations appointment scheduler microservice.

    **Developers**

## Configure area paths for Teams

Create a new area path for each new Azure DevOps team. This keeps
backlogs, boards, and queries specific to each team while allowing
access to the shared backlog.
