# Support and troubleshooting

Azure DevOps requires minimal support, but issues can still arise.
Follow these steps to get help:

## General support

-   **Check Service Notifications**: For updates about issues or
    disruptions.

-   **Check Microsoft Service Status**: Visit [Azure DevOps -
    Status](https://status.dev.azure.com/) for service updates.

-   **Monitor the Developer Channel**: Check the [Visual Studio
    Developer Azure DevOps
    Channel](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/AzureDevOps) to
    upvote relevant issues.

-   **Ask a Project Admin**: Contact your Project Administrator if you
    need further help.

-   **Contact the Organisation Owner**: For help with unresolved issues,
    speak to the Organisation Owner who can raise a support request with
    Microsoft.

-   **Log a Service Request:** If the Organisation Owner is unavailable
    or your query is urgent, raise a service request (addressed to the
    *Corporate Application* team). This option is only available to
    users of the *NHS-Wales-Digital* Organisation.

## Unable to clone large Git repos

Raise a service request to join the *NWI_Zscaler_Allow_AzureDevops Entra
group* If you need to clone large repos. On approval, choose *Update
Policy* in your zscaler desktop application.

In the meantime, work around the issue using these commands:

mkdir *\<Repo Name\>*

cd *\<Repo Name\>*

git init

git remote add origin *\<Your repo URL\>*

git pull \# results in curl 56 failure.

git pull \# succeeds.

## Fixing issues with SSL certificates

Errors may occur if Git isn't configured to use the Windows Certificate
Store for SSL verification:

fatal: unable to access \'https://\<your-repo-url\>\': SSL certificate
problem: unable to get local issuer certificate

fatal: unable to access \'https://\<your-repo-url\>\': schannel
CertGetCertificateChain trust error CERT_TRUST_IS_PARTIAL_CHAIN

To fix them, run the following command in Git Bash. Alternatively, if
you're using Visual Studio set the *cryptographic network provider* to
*schannel* in the Git settings:

git config \--global http.sslBackend schannel
