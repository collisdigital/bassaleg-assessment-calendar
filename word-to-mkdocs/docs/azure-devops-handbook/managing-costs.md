# Managing costs

To control and optimise costs Organisation Owners **SHOULD:**

-   **Monitor Azure DevOps costs**: Review consumption costs against
    your Azure subscription **weekly** to spot unexpected charges early.

-   **Downgrade or remove inactive users**: Downgrade inactive users to
    Stakeholder after **8 weeks.** Remove users who haven't used Azure
    DevOps for **6 months.**

-   **Set a monthly cost threshold:** Set alerts for when costs exceed a
    threshold and review cost breakdowns in the \"*Cost Management +
    Billing*\" section of the Azure portal.
