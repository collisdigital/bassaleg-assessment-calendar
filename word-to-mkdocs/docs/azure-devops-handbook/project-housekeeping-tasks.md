# Project housekeeping tasks

Follow these **RECOMMENDED** practices to keep projects clean and
well-organised:

-   **Set artifact retention policies** Keep only the ***latest**,
    **previous*** and ***active*** releases versions to minimise storage
    costs.

-   **Pipeline run retention:** Retain only recent, relevant runs for
    debugging. Set retention policies to delete pipeline runs after
    ***30 days***.

-   **Delete obsolete branches**. Remove inactive or redundant branches
    to remove clutter.

-   **Clean agent pools**: Clean stale directories and repositories on
    > self-hosted agents **weekly** to avoid disk space issues.

-   **Keep agents updated**: Enable automatic updates for minor version
    > changes and manually upgrade for major updates.
