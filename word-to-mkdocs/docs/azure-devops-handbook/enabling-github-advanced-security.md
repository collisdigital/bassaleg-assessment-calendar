# Enabling GitHub advanced security

Enabling **GitHub Advanced Security** helps you find & fix security
issues in your code but does incur extra costs. So, check with your line
manager or Organisation Owner before enabling it.

The following practices are **RECOMMENDED**:

-   **Block Secrets on Push:** Enable the \"*Block secrets on push*\"
    setting to prevent accidental exposure of secrets in your code**.**

-   **Review and Resolve Flagged Secrets:** Address other secrets
    flagged by Azure DevOps (even if not blocked). E.g. by moving them
    to secure storage like Azure Key Vault.

-   **Conducting Dependency Scanning:** Add the Dependency Scanning task
    to your Azure Pipelines to identify vulnerabilities in third-party
    libraries.

-   **Code Scanning with CodeQL:** Add the CodeQL scanning task to your
    pipelines to identify security vulnerabilities and code quality
    issues**.**

-   **Microsoft Security DevOps Extension:** Install this to use static
    analysis tools like *ESLint*, *Checkov*, and *Terrascan* to scan for
    vulnerabilities in Azure Pipelines.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    Security tools may flag valid code (false positives) or miss vulnerabilities (false negatives).
