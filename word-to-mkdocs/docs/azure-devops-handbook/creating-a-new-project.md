| **description:** | Provide a clear, searchable project description. |

## Assign project admins

Every project **SHOULD** have **two** project administrators. A project
administrator manages access, configures project settings and customises
boards for teams and workflows.

send telemetry or access repositories automatically in project settings
before using the project.
