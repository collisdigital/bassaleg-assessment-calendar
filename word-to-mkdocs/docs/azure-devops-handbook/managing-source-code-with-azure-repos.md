# Managing source code with Azure repos

Following the practices in this section aligns with *SDS-CS-1 Using
Source Control*, improving traceability, linking work items to code
changes, and enhancing code quality.

    SDS-CS-1 Using Source Control

## How do you branch and release?

You have freedom to choose your branching and release strategies, but
you **SHOULD** follow these key practices to maintain simplicity and
consistency:

-   **Use feature branches**: Develop new features and fix bugs in
    > dedicated branches.

-   **Merge through pull requests (PRs)**: Integrate changes into the
    > main branch using PRs.

-   **Keep the main branch clean**: Ensure the main branch is functional
    > & up to date.

-   **Git Tagging:** Tag the release commit to ensure traceability and
    > version identification.

## Recommended naming conventions

Name Git repositories in lowercase with hyphens. Prefixing with the
Azure DevOps project or team name is **RECOMMENDED** but not required.

| **COMPONENT** | **NAMING CONVENTION** | **examples** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **REPOSITORY** | Lowercase, hyphens-separated\ \<pr oject-name\>:\<purpose\> | wis-api welshpas-web wcp-integration-services |
| **TAG** | \<Maj or\>.\<Minor\>.\<Patch\> | 2.0.0 |

Use this convention for branch names. You may not need them all, it
depends on your strategy.

| **BRANCH TYPE** | **NAMING CONVENTION** | **examples** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MAIN** | 'main' | main |
| **DEVELOP** | 'develop' | develop |
| **FEATURE** | feature/*\<work-item-number\>-\<feature-name\>* | feature/450447-add-cors-policy |
| **RELEASE** | release/*\<version-number\>* | release/2.0.0 |
| **BUGFIX** | bugfix/*\<issue-number\>-\<description\>* | bugfix/46627-fix-SMS-Input-Error |
| **HOTFIX** | hotfix/*\<issue-number\>-\<description\>* | hotfix/67891-critical-patch |

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    - Always link branches to corresponding work items,

    - Delete redundant feature branches.

## Configure repository settings for commit linking

You **SHOULD** ensure these settings are applied across all branches:

-   **Enable Commit Mention Linking:** Automatically link commits to
    work items by including the work item ID (e.g., #123) in the commit
    message.

-   **Ensure Work Item Resolution:** Automatically update work item
    status based on commit actions.

## Configure repository policies for email validation

-   **Commit author email validation**: Block pushes from emails not
    matching .\*@wales\\.nhs\\.uk\$

## Configure branch policies

Enable these settings on main and release branches to support effective
branching and release:

-   **Require a minimum number of reviewers:** Ensure pull requests are
    subject to code review.

-   **Require linked work items:** Ensure pull requests are linked to
    work items.

-   **Require comments resolution:** Address comments before merging
    pull requests.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Enable Build Validation**: Trigger a build pipeline on pull
    requests to validate code quality.

-   **Add a Code Coverage Status Check:** Ensure coverage targets are
    met before merging.

-   **Set Coverage Thresholds:** Define differential (diff) thresholds
    in *azurepipelines-coverage.yml* or *.runsettings* to match your
    *Definition of Done*.

-   **Address Insufficient Coverage:** Use the \"*Require comments
    resolution*\" policy to address any insufficient coverage before
    merging.

-   **Review Coverage Thresholds**: Regularly review thresholds to meet
    quality standards.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    **Don't obsess over Code Coverage!**

    Use it as a guide but focus on meaningful tests that ensure your code works as expected.

    **Set Up Pipelines for Validation and Coverage**

    Configure a build pipeline for validation and code coverage checks, In the next section, we'll show you how to set up pipelines for testing & deployment.
