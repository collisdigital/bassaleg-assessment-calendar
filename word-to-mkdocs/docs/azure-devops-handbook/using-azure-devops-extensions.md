# Using Azure DevOps extensions

Extensions add extra capabilities but require careful management. Follow
these practices to manage them safely:

-   **Evaluate First:** Before requesting an extension, evaluate it
    using Microsoft's criteria as extensions impact all users once
    installed.

-   **Request Approval:** Consult the Organisation Owner before
    requesting a new extension.

-   **Avoid Dependency:** Do not build critical workflows around
    extensions. They are unsupported and may be removed at any time,
    even if from Microsoft.

-   **Cybersecurity Approval:** Obtain approval from Cyber Security for
    extensions accessing code repos or exporting telemetry.

-   **Disable telemetry:** Turn off telemetry and intrusive features.

-   **Audit Regularly:** Periodically review extensions to ensure
    > compliance with privacy and security policies.
