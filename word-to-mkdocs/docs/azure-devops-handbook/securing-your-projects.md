# Securing your projects

You **MUST** follow these essential practices to ensure robust security:

-   Review permissions **monthly**, ensuring access follows the
    *least-privilege principle*.

-   Remove permissions **as soon as** users no longer need access.

-   Use fine-grained permissions to restrict access to what's necessary.

-   Prefer *Federated Identity* over *Service Connections* when
    possible.

-   Avoid *Personal Access Tokens (PATs)* but if used, recycle them
    every ***90 days***.

-   Limit access to the minimum required for each user.
