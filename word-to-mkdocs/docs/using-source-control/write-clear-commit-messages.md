# Write clear commit messages

Commit messages are essential for understanding the history, context,
and purpose of code changes. Following these standards will:

-   Improve collaboration and communication across teams.

-   Make it easier to debug, trace changes and manage the codebase
    effectively.

-   Ensure consistency and professionalism in your projects.

You **MUST** write a commit message for every change.

Commit messages **MUST** be clear, concise, and follow a consistent
format.

You **SHOULD:**

-   Use the Conventional Commits specification to structure your
    messages.

-   Link commits to work items, bugs, or tasks using identifiers.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    In Visual Studio, include the work item ID, e.g., #123 , in your commit message. Visual Studio will automatically link the commit to the corresponding work item.

Additional **RECOMMENDATIONS**:

-   Consider tools like VsCommitizen or commitlint to help enforce
    > standards.

-   Use branch policies to ensure commit messages comply with
    > requirements.

-   Use \"because\" in your message to clarify the reasoning behind
    > changes.

## Commit message standard

Each commit message **MUST** follow this template:

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    *\<type**\>\[optional scope\]: description*

    *\[optional body\]*

    *\[optional footers\]*

*\<type\>:* describes the purpose of the commit. You **MUST** append a !
to *\<type\>* if the commit introduces a breaking change (e.g. feat!).

| **TYPE** | **DESCRIPTION** |
| --- | --- |
| feat**:** | A new feature. |
| fix**:** | A bug fix. |
| build**:** | Changes to the build system or dependencies. |
| chore**:** | Maintenance tasks that do not affect application functionality. |
| ci**:** | Changes to CI/CD pipelines or configuration. |
| docs**:** | Documentation updates. |
| style**:** | Code formatting changes (e.g., indentation, spacing) without functional impact. |
| refactor**:** | Code changes that improve structure & clarity without changing behaviour. |
| perf**:** | Performance improvements. |
| test**:** | Adding or modifying tests |

The *\<summary\>* **MUST**:

-   Be 50 characters or fewer.

-   Use the imperative mood (e.g. \"Add login validation\").

The *\<body\>* **SHOULD**:

-   Provide additional context (e.g. **why** a change was made).

-   Be wrapped at 72 characters per line for readability.

Additional **RECOMMENDATIONS**:

-   Avoid ending with punctuation.
