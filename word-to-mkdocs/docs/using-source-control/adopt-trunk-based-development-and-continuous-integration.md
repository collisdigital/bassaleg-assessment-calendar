# Adopt trunk-based development and continuous integration

Trunk-Based Development simplifies source control by deploying directly
from the trunk branch (e.g., main or master). You **SHOULD** adopt this
approach where feasible, as it minimises the complexity of managing
long-lived branches.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:

-   Write a comprehensive suite of automated tests to keep branches
    deployable.

-   Aim for continuous integration and frequent deployments from the
    trunk.

**When to Consider Alternatives**:

If your project requires extensive experimentation or long-term feature
development, ensure robust practices for merging changes from feature
branches.
