# Keep your repo organised

You **SHOULD** maintain clean, organised repositories by:

-   Removing stale or unused projects.

-   Reviewing & revoking unnecessary permissions with Windows Groups for
    access control.

Where possible, projects **SHOULD** be open for others to read and
contribute.
