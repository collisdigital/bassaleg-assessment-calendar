# Follow a branching strategy

You **MUST** implement a branching strategy that fits your team\'s
needs. A clear strategy helps minimise risks like introducing bugs or
conflicts. While [Trunk-Based
Development](adopt-trunk-based-development-and-continuous-integration.md)
is **RECOMMENDED**, select the approach best suited to your project.

Your branching strategy **MUST**:

-   Define a consistent branch naming convention. See the Azure DevOps
    handbook for details.

-   Be documented in the project's README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file or
    > team wiki.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    Use tools like Jakob Ehn's *GitFlow for Visual Studio* if they simplify branch management for your team.
