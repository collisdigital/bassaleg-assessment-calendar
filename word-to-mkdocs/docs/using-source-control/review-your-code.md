# Review your code

Code reviews help improve code quality, increase team knowledge, and
develop coding skills, particularly for new team members. While it is
not always possible to have your code reviewed before committing to the
main branch, it is **RECOMMENDED**.

When implementing code reviews, you **MUST** ensure the following are
clearly documented in the project's README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file.
or team wiki:

-   The purpose of code reviews and the coding standards your code must
    adhere to.

-   The minimum number of reviewers required to approve a commit. Two
    reviewers are **RECOMMENDED.**

Additional **RECOMMENDATIONS**:

-   Consider using *pair programming* for real-time code review and
    feedback.

-   Use *Pull Requests* to facilitate and track your code reviews.

    **ISO 9001:2015 Audit Recommendation**

    An external ISO 9001:2015 audit in 2020 recommnded that teams define a minimum number of code reviewers rather than inviting the entire team to review a commit.
