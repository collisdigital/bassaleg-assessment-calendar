-   Strategies for organising Git repositories.

-   Strategies for branching and merging.

-   [Good practice checklist](../restful-api-standards/essential-good-practice-checklist.md).

## Out-of-scope

-   In depth guidance for creating and configuring Git repos. See our
    Azure DevOps handbook for details.

-   This guide is for Azure DevOps users, specifically those using Azure
    Repos. GitHub users may find it helpful, but it is not tailored for
    them.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
