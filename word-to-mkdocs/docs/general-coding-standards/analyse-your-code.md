# Analyse your code

## Create a plan

You **MUST** conduct code analysis and address the issues you find.
Doing this in both your IDE and build & integration pipelines will
improve your code, making it easier to maintain, faster, and more
secure.

Code analysis can be complex, but this section outlines the steps you
**SHOULD** follow. Create a tailored plan for your team that you
regularly review and improve.

## Calculate code metrics to spot problems

Calculate code metrics for each project in your solution and address any
that exceed acceptable limits. The table below shows **RECOMMENDED**
levels for each metric.

|  | **Maintainability Index** | **Cyclomatic Complexity** | **Depth of Imheritance** | **Class Coupling** | **Lines of Executable code** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 20 - 100 | \< 7 | \< 5 | \< 9 | \< 40 |

## Calculate code coverage

Calculate test coverage and use the results to identify areas for
improvement.

Generate and publish a code coverage report in your pipelines.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    Aim to cover a large portion of your code with tests. But prioritise integration tests for areas prone to regressions. This may prove more effective than having unit tests for every method.

    Note: Visual Studio's code coverage feature is available only in the Enterprise edition.

## Check code for style and quality

Ensure your code follows the style ([naming](#_NAMING),
[layout](follow-microsofts-coding-conventions.md), [language](follow-microsofts-coding-conventions.md))
and quality conventions described or referenced in this document.

**Code Style Options and Analyser Rules**

Visual Studio offers a code style options box and Roslyn analyser code
style rules. With newer versions of Visual Studio and the .NET SDK, you
can run these rules at build time.

Use the dotnet format tool in your build and integration pipelines to
check for code style. See later in this section for details.

## Use roslyn analysers to ensure .NET code quality

Use Roslyn compiler analysers to check .NET code for style, quality,
maintainability and other issues. They are available from Microsoft and
third-party providers.

**How Roslyn Analysers work**:

-   **Design-Time Analysis**: Analysers run on open files in the IDE,
    providing immediate feedback.

-   **Build-Time Analysis**: Can be configured to run during builds to
    enforce consistent standards.

Use NuGet packages to integrate analysers directly in your code. Avoid
relying solely on IDE-specific tools like Visual Studio extensions,
ReSharper and SonarQube.

**Default Analysers in .NET SDKs**

The latest .NET SDKs include many Roslyn analysers pre-installed. The
image below shows the analysers available when creating an ASP.NET
project targeting .NET 8.0 in Visual Studio.

If using older SDKs, add analysers like
Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers NuGet package.

Figure 1 Use Roslyn analysers to check your code

**\
**

**Third-party Analysers**

Include a security analyser, such as SonarAnalyzer.CSharp or
SecurityCodeScan.VS2019. For assistance, ask the Software Development
Manager or Cyber Security team.

**Enabling Rules**

Roslyn analysers allow you to configure specific rules. In a .NET 6.0+
project, created with Visual Studio, only a few rules are enabled by
default. Enable all relevant rules, disabling only those that produce
false positives or are not relevant.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    **Introducing Code Analysis**\ Enabling code analysis with all rules on a large codebase can be overwhelming. Start with a few rules and gradually add more until all are enabled.

    **Important:**\ Code analysis may slow down your development environment. Balance error detection with productivity. Consider running resource-intensive analysis in build or integration pipelines.

## Configure code analysis rules

Follow these steps when configuring code analysis:

| **CONFIGURATION STEP** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **ADD AN .editorconfig FILE** | Place in the root of your solution and commit to source control to ensure consistent settings across the team. |
| **SET-UP INITIAL RULES** | Generate settings using Visual Studio's code style options or a template (see further reading). Adjust rules to align with team or organisational conventions. |
| **DEFINE RULE SEVERITY** | Set critical rules to *error* to ensure violations fail the build. Configure the Directory.build.props or .csproj files (SDK-style projects) to enable style and quality checks during builds. |
| **ENFORCE CODE STYLE** | Enforce code style checks during builds where your .NET version supports it. |
| **APPLY GOOD PRACTICE** | Treat warnings as errors to promote higher code quality. |
