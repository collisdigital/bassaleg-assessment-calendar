# Write clean code

Your code **SHOULD**:

-   Be concise, expressive and focused on doing one thing well.

-   Use short methods (20-40 lines) with a single purpose.

-   Include written tests, be self-documenting and easy to read.

-   Have classes with high cohesion, containing clearly related methods
    > that share class properties.

-   Prefer using or import statements instead of fully qualified type
    > names.

Your code **SHOULD NOT**:

-   Contain unused using (Java) or import (C#) statements.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    Use the using static directive (C#6) to ensure method names are prefixed with their class for clarity.

    Consider global using directives and implicit usings to reduce clutter and improve readability.
