# Roles & responsibilities

We write this for Test Analysts. But everyone has a part to play :-

-   Business analysts determine the need for concurrency in the
    requirements.

-   Architects and developers build concurrency control into the
    designs.

-   Developers and testers verify these designs beyond the user
    interface.

-   Support run surveillance scripts to continue testing after
    deployment.

-   Everyone takes part in sprint ceremonies. Because these interactions
    refine your approach, ensuring it's fit for purpose.

Only by doing this, will you have confidence to test for lost updates
and concurrency bugs.
