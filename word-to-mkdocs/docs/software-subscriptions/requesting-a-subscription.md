# Requesting a subscription

You can request a common subscription from the Software Development
Manager by logging a call to the **Corporate Applications** team, for
the attention of the Software Development Manager.

If you need an Azure DevOps subscription, check with the Azure DevOps
Organisation owner first. As only subscriptions for the
*NHS-Wales-Digital* Azure DevOps instance can be allocated by the
Software Development Manager.

When requesting a subscription for a new member of staff, you **SHOULD**
do so before their start date. While we aim to process requests on the
same day this isn't always possible.

For agency staff you **MUST** provide a cost code along with their
contract start and end dates. Ask the contract manager to supply these.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    If the Software Development Manager is unavailable or the request cannot be processed, download a trial version until your request is handled.

## Requesting GitHub copilot business

Follow these steps to request *GitHub Copilot Business*, an AI-powered
coding assistant for your development environment. *Note***:** You'll
also need a *GitHub Enterprise* subscription.

1.  First, check if you already have GitHub Enterprise**.** *VS
    Enterprise* and *VS Professional* include it by default, but *VS
    Test Professional* does not.

2.  It's often worth having a *VS Professional* subscription anyway.
    Raise a service request to the **Corporate Applications team**,
    addressed to the Software Development Manager. They will allocate
    the subscription and forward your request for *GitHub CoPilot
    Business*.

3.  If you don't need a *VS Professional* subscription, raise a service
    request to the **GitHub GIG CYMRU** **team**. They'll allocate
    *GitHub Copilot Business (*and *GitHub Enterprise* if needed).
    *Note***:** You may need to provide extra information, such as a
    cost code.[]
