# Managing subscriptions

Subscriptions are typically managed using the vendor\'s management
portal or, in the case of Azure DevOps, via the Azure DevOps software
itself. One exception is *HL7 Edit* licenses, which are tracked using a
spreadsheet.

The following links are used to assign subscriptions by the Software
Development Manager.
