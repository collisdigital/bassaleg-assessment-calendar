# Data classification

You **MUST** classify resource data types according to the platform
team's data classification framework (see [Appendix
A](appendix-a-classifications.md)).

Based on the classification, you **MUST** apply the appropriate security
controls.

For detailed guidance on implementing security measures, refer to the
[Authentication and Authorisation](authentication-and-authorisation.md)
