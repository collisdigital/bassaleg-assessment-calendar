# Retrieving related data

## Using seprarate urls for related resources

Endpoints **SHOULD** return only primary resources by default.

To prevent overloading clients, the server **MAY** offer alternative
endpoints to fetch related data.

URLs **SHOULD NOT** exceed two levels of nesting to maintain readability
and usability.

If a resource can be independently accessed without its parent, it
**SHOULD** have its own top-level endpoint.

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    *{base}/appointmentsService/patients*

    *{base}/appointmentsService/patients/{id}*

    *{base}/appointmentsService/patients/{id}/conditions*

    *{base}/appointmentsService/patients/{id}/conditions/{id}*

    *{base}*/appointmentsService/patients/*{id}*/encounters/*{id}*/observations/*{id}*

## Returning related resources using query parameters

The server **MAY** support include and expand query parameters to
optimise data retrieval.

include **MUST** return navigation links for the specified related
resources.

expand **MUST** embed related data directly within the response.

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    *{base}/appointmentsService/patients/{id}?include=conditions*

    *{base}/appointmentsService/patients/{id}?expand=practitioners,conditions*

Additional **RECOMMENDATIONS**:

-   **Separate URLs vs Query Parameters**: Use query parameters only
    when they add value. For complex data retrieval, consider GraphQL.

-   **Balance Performance and Usability**: Overuse of expand can degrade
    performance, while excessive nesting complicates API navigation.
