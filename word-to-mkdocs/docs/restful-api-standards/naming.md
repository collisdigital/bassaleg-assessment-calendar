# Naming

## Resource names

Resource names **SHOULD** be clear, descriptive and written in
*lowerCamelCase*. Use plural nouns in URLs and to identify resource
collections in JSON payloads. Use the singular form to identify an
individual resource in a JSON payload.

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    */{base}*/patients/{id*}*

    */{base}*/Patient/{id*}*

    */{base}*/getPatient/{id*}*

Prefer nouns to verbs, even if the noun is not immediately obvious.

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    */{base}*/uk-who/calculation

    */{base}*/uk-who/calculate

## Resource identifiers

Resource identifiers **MUST** serve as unique references for resources.
It is **RECOMMENDED** to use the field name \"*id*\" or to concatenate
the resource name with \"*Id*\" when referencing these identifiers.

Resource identifiers **MUST** be URL safe and not expose implementation
details such as database primary keys.

## Resource fields

Resource fields **MUST** be descriptive and use *lowerCamelCase*.

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    {

    \"data\": {

    \"patients\": \[

    {

    \"firstName\": \"Humphrey\",

    // \... other patient details \...

    },

    // \... more patients \...

    \]

    }

    }

## Query parameters

Query parameters **SHOULD** be written in *lowerCamelCase*.

You **SHOULD NOT** define query parameters with names that differ only
in case.

The server **SHOULD NOT** be case sensitive when processing query
parameters.

When query parameters are treated as strings they present an opportunity
for injection attacks. To minimise risk, the server **SHOULD** constrain
the values of string filters to enumerations or regular expressions.

## Reserved names

You **SHOULD** adhere to the defined behaviour for query parameters as
described in this standard. These names are reserved for their intended
purposes and **MUST NOT** be repurposed.
