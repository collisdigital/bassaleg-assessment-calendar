# General principles

The following principles guide these standards:

-   Prioritise user needs.

-   Treat APIs as products, with dedicated teams, lifecycles, and
    roadmaps.

-   Make APIs the primary interface for system interactions.

-   Build APIs that are easy to learn, use, reuse, and integrate.

-   Enable portability with container technologies like Docker.

-   Adopt DevOps practices to deliver continuous value.

-   Build APIs that conform to HL7 FHIR as a foundational
    > interoperability standard.

-   Use REST as the default design style, although you **MAY** choose
    > alternatives when justified.
