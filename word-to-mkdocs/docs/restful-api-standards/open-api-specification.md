# Open API specification

You **SHOULD** write an OpenAPI specification before generating
server-side code.

A design-first approach **SHOULD** be used to enable earlier testing and
validation. However, you **MAY** adopt a code-first approach where it
better suits the needs of your project. Refer to the
[Documentation](documentation.md) section for further guidance.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    Use the API platform team's Open API template to ensure your API includes required security schemas and essential operations like [Ping and Status](api-management.md).
