# Payload rules

Some rules in this section align with JSON API, while others differ. You
**MAY** follow the complete JSON API specification, but you **MUST**
carefully consider its impact.

## Encoding and content negotiation

For encoding, you **SHOULD** use \"UTF-8\".

Unicode **MUST** be used as the standard encoding for all text
representations of dates in APIs, and it is the default for JSON.

The server **SHOULD** represent resources in JSON (RFC 8259/ECMA-404) by
default, defined as application/json in the OpenAPI specification.

You **MAY** add extra media types, but they **MUST** be described in the
OpenAPI definition.

If your API can return multiple media types, it **SHOULD** return the
first supported type indicated in the HTTP Request's Accept header.

If the requested media types are unsupported, the server **SHOULD**
return an HTTP response with status 415 UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE.

## Date formats

HTTP headers containing datetime values **MUST** use the RFC 5322
format:

-   ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z

Dates or timestamps in the JSON payload of the response **MUST** conform to
the RFC 3339 format:

-   YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ

## Payload size

For performance reasons, the server **SHOULD** use [paging](paging.md) for
large datasets or binary objects.\
The server **SHOULD** keep the total payload size below 2 MB and
**MUST** ensure that it does not exceed 10 MB, as this is a hard limit
for some platforms.
