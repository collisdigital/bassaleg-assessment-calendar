# HTTP implementation

APIs **MUST** follow standard HTTP semantics to ensure consistency,
predictability and interoperability. This section outlines good
practice, but refer to official specs when needed:

!!! info "Further reading and information"
    [RFC 9110: HTTP Semantics - Status Codes (rfc-editor.org)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-status-codes)

    [API design best practices - Conform to HTTP semantics \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design#conform-to-http-semantics)

## Hypermedia (hateos)

A RESTful API **MUST** implement *Hypermedia as the Engine of
Application State (HATEOAS)* to be classified as *Richardson Level 3*.
HATEOAS allows clients to navigate and manipulate resources dynamically
without requiring prior knowledge of specific URIs.

However, *HATEOAS* is NOT required for APIs in this organisation**.**
But if implemented:

-   The API **MUST** provide hypermedia links to guide clients on
    available actions.

-   These links **SHOULD** use standard link relations where possible
    (e.g. as defined in RFC 8288) and **MUST** be documented in the
    API's OpenAPI definition.

    [RFC 8288: Web Linking](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8288.html)

## HTTP verbs and resource operations

APIs **MUST** use standard HTTP methods correctly to ensure predictable
behaviour.

-   APIs **MUST** only expose necessary HTTP methods and **MUST**
    document them in the [OpenAPI definition](documentation.md).

-   APIs **SHOULD** return 405 Method Not Allowed for unsupported HTTP
    methods instead of silently ignoring them.

-   APIs **MUST** adhere to the standard HTTP semantics defined in *RFC
    9110,* including idempotency rules.

-   Non-standard HTTP verbs **MUST NOT** be used.

!!! info "Further reading and information"
    [RFC 9110: HTTP Semantics - Status Codes (rfc-editor.org)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-status-codes)

## Standard HTTP methods and usage

| **OPERATION** | **HTTP VERB** | **PATH** | **REQUEST BODY** | **RESPONSE BODY** | **IDEMPOTENT** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **LIST** | GET | /resources | None | Collection Resource | ✅Yes |
| **RETRIEVE** | GET | /resources/*{id}* | None | Resource | ✅Yes |
| **CREATE** | POST | /resources | Resource | Resource | ❌ No |
| **REPLACE** | PUT | /resources/*{id}* | Resource | Resource | ✅Yes |
| **MODIFY** | PATCH | /resources/*{id}* | Partial Resource | Resource | ❌ No |
| **DELETE** | DELETE | /resources/*{id}* | None | None | ✅Yes |
| **RETRIEVE HEADERS** | HEAD | /resources/*{id}* | None | None | ✅Yes |
| **QUERY CAPABILITIES** | OPTIONS | /resources | None | Allowed Methods | ✅Yes |

-   GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and DELETE **MUST NOT** modify resources.

-   PUT and DELETE **MUST** be idempotent to ensure safe retries.

-   PATCH is NOT idempotent unless explicitly designed to be.

-   POST **MUST** be used for non-idempotent operations such as resource
    creation.

## HTTP request headers

PIs **MUST** support and handle the following request headers:

| **HEADER** | **DESCRIPTION** |
| --- | --- |
| Authorization | Used for authentication. APIs **MUST** validate this header and reject malformed requests. |
| Content-Type | **MUST** be included in requests with a body. Allowed values: *application/json, application/xml, multipart/form-data, application/x-www-form-urlencoded*. |
| Date | **MUST** be formatted as per RFC 5322, e.g. Tue, *11 Oct 2022 09:27:30 GMT.* |

!!! info "Further reading and information"
    [RFC 5322 - Internet Message Format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322)

APIs **SHOULD** support the following request headers:

| **HEADER** | **DESCRIPTION** |
| --- | --- |
| Accept | Specifies the response format. Default: *application/json*. |
| Access-Control-Request-Method | Used in CORS preflight requests to indicate the intended HTTP method. |

APIs **MAY** support additional request headers:

| **HEADER** | **DESCRIPTION** |
| --- | --- |
| x-api-key | A legacy authentication method. **MAY** be used only when legacy support is required. Prefer Authorization |
| X-Audit-Consent | JSON-encoded FHIR consent resource (base64, max 8KB). |
| X-Audit-Device | FHIR identifier for the client device (base64, max 8KB). |
| X-Au dit-Organisation | FHIR identifier for the client organisation (base64, max 8KB). |
| X-Audit-User | FHIR identifier for the authenticated user (base64, max 8KB). |
| X-Au thenticated_User | Identifies the client system for auditing. |
| Cache-Control | Controls caching (e.g. *no-store*). |
| Connection | Manages connection behaviour (e.g. *keep-alive*). |
| If-Match , If-None-Match | Used for optimistic concurrency control with resource updates. |
| Origin | If present, APIs **MUST** validate it against a list of allowed origins to ensure security. |
| X-Request-Id | A unique identifier for the API request. If not provided by the client, this identifier **MAY** be generated in the API Gateway. |

## HTTP response headers

APIs **SHOULD** return the following response headers:

| **HEADER** | **DESCRIPTION** |
| --- | --- |
| Cache-Control | Controls caching (e.g. *no-store or private, max-age=3600*). |
| Content-Security-Policy | Defines security policies to mitigate XSS and injection (e.g. *frame-ancestors \'none\'*). |
| Content-Type | Specifies the response media type (e.g. *application/json or application/xml*). Used only if a message body is returned. |
| Location | On successful resource creation Post, the API **MUST** return a 201 CREATED status and a Location header with the new resource's relative URL. |
| Request-Id | Echoes the unique request identifier provided by the client. |
| Strict-Transport-Security | Enforces HTTPS (e.g. *max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains*). |
| WWW-Authenticate | Specifies the required authentication method (e.g. *Bearer realm=\"nhswales365\", authorization_uri=\"\...\").* |
| X-Content-Type-Options | Prevents MIME sniffing (e.g. *nosniff*). |
| X-Frame-Options | Prevents clickjacking (e.g. *SAMEORIGIN or DENY*). |

The following optional response headers **MAY** apply:

| **HEADER** | **DESCRIPTION** |
| --- | --- |
| Access-Control-Allow-Origin | Specifies allowed origins for web access. If used, the value **MUST** be non-wildcard (i.e., *not \**). |
| Content-Security-Policy | Restricts content sources (e.g. *default-src \'none\'*). |
| Date | Response timestamp in RFC 5322 format (e.g. *Tue, 11 Oct 2022 09:27:31 GMT*). |
| ETag | Indicates the resource version. Used with If-Match / If-None-Match for optimistic concurrency control. |
| Expires | The date/time after which the response is considered stale (RFC 5322 format). |
| Feature-Policy | Defines permitted client-side features (e.g. *none*). |
| Referrer-Policy | Specifies the level of referrer information to include (e.g. *no-referrer*). |
| Retry-After | Indicates when a client should retry a failed request (expressed in seconds or as a date - RFC 5322 format. RFC 5322 is **RECOMMENDED**. |

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    Additional headers **MAY** be added or modified by the API gateway to [deprecate or retire](api-management.md) an API or apply [rate limiting](api-management.md), for example. Speak to the platform team for more help.

## Return HTTP status codes

The server **MUST** return the correct HTTP status code for each API
operation, as per RFC 9110. The table below lists common status codes,
but others **MAY** be used if needed.

-   Yes" means the status code applies to that operation.

-   An empty cell means the code is not usually used for that operation.

| **HTTP STATUS CODE** | ** GET** * *(COL LECTI ON)** | ** GET** **(R ESOUR CE)** | **P OST** * *(COL LECTI ON)** | ** PUT** **(R ESOUR CE)** | **PA TCH** **(R ESOUR CE)** | **DEL ETE** **(R ESOUR CE)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 200 OK | ✅Yes | ✅Yes |  | ✅Yes | S | ee ca veats below |  |
| 201 CREATED |  |  | ✅Yes |  |  |  |

**Caveats and edge cases**

-   While PATCH can return 200 OK with the updated resource, 202
    ACCEPTED is preferred for asynchronous processing. But some
    implementations **MAY** choose to return 200 OK instead.

-   304 NOT MODIFIED applies only when the API supports caching with
    conditional GET requests. The server **MAY** return 304 NOT MODIFIED
    if the client's cached version is still valid.

```{=html}

```
-   Use 409 CONFLICT when there\'s a conflict with the current state of
    the target resource. Use 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY when the server
    understands the request but can\'t process it due to semantic
    errors.

-   Use 409 CONFLICT when there\'s a conflict with the current state of
    the target resource. Use 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY when the server
    understands the request but can\'t process it due to semantic
    errors.

-   While 415 UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE is typically used for POST, PUT and
    PATCH, it **MAY** apply to GET if a body is sent with an unsupported
    media type --- although this is rare.

-   412 PRECONDITION FAILED and 428 PRECONDITIONS **REQUIRED** are typically
    used for POST, PUT and PATCH. However, some designs **MAY** also
    apply them to DETETE if preconditions are enforced.

> Use 428 PRECONDITIONS **REQUIRED** when the server requires the request to
> be conditional, typically to prevent the \"lost update\" problem. Use
> 412 PRECONDITION FAILED when a precondition specified in the request
> isn\'t met.

-   Typically our API platform will apply rate limiting and return 429
    TOO MANY REQUESTS when appropriate.

-   Some designs **MAY** extend the use of 501 NOT IMPLEMENTED to other
    methods if a particular method is not supported by the server.
