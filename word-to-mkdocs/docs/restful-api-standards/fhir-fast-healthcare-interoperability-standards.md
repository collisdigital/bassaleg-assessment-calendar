# FHIR (fast healthcare interoperability standards)

APIs **MUST** conform to the FHIR R4 specification when a relevant FHIR
profile exists. Where no suitable profile is available, you may need to
model custom resources following FHIR principles.

FHIR R4 already addresses many fundamental aspects of RESTful API
design. If your API implementation is based on FHIR, you can jump
directly to the [Security](#security-standards) section.
