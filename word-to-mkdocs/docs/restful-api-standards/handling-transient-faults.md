# Handling transient faults

APIs **MUST** be designed to handle transient faults caused by temporary
network issues, timeouts, or service disruptions. Clients **SHOULD**
implement retry strategies to maintain reliability without overwhelming
the system.

## Identifying transient faults

The API **MUST** clearly define transient faults and distinguish them
from permanent failures.

The API **MUST** specify which [HTTP status
codes](http-implementation.md) indicate transient faults that are
safe to retry:

-   5xx errors (e.g. 500 Internal Server Error) indicate server-side
    faults.

-   Some 4xx errors **MAY** also be transient and safe to retry, such as:

    -   429 Too Many Requests (after respecting Retry-After).

    -   408 Request Timeout, if caused by temporary network issues.

    -   409 Conflict, if due to a temporary resource state.

## Retry strategies

Clients **MUST** ensure retries do not introduce unintended side
effects. APIs **MUST** be *idempotent* where possible.

If an API returns Retry-After, clients **MUST** wait before retrying.

Clients **SHOULD** use *exponential backoff* with *jitter* to avoid
spikes in retry traffic.

The API **SHOULD** document:

-   The m*aximum number of retry attempts* before a failure is
    considered permanent.

-   *Recommended wait times* between retries.

-   *Rate limits* to avoid excessive retries.

Additional **RECOMMENDATIONS**:

-   APIs **SHOULD** use *circuit breakers* to prevent repeated calls
    > when a service remains unavailable.

-   Clients **SHOULD** *randomise retries* to prevent simultaneous retry
    > bursts.

-   If the API is deployed on Apigee, it **MUST** integrate with
    > Apigee's transient fault handling features.
