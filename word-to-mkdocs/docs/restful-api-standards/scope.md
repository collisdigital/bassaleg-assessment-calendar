# Scope

## In-scope

These standards apply to RESTful APIs designed and built for:

-   Internal use within the organisation.

-   External use by clients, partners, or third parties.

A [good practice checklist](essential-good-practice-checklist.md) is also
included to assist teams in achieving compliance.

## Out-of-scope

These standards do not apply to:

-   Non-RESTful APIs, including GraphQL, gRPC, and event-driven APIs
    (e.g. Azure Functions).

-   APIs designed primarily to handle large binary data (e.g. image or
    file delivery).

-   Topics outside API design and implementation, such as Domain-driven
    design or microservices architecture.

-   Infrastructure, networking, or Web Application Firewalls (WAF).

-   API publishing pipelines (e.g. via Apigee).

-   Telemetry, monitoring, or general software development practices.
