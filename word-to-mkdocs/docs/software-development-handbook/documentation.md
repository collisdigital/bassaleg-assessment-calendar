# Documentation

Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential. All our guides and
standards include sections on writing effective documentation. Key
principles for good documentation include:

-   Follow company-wide writing guidelines and standards

-   Ensure docs reflects the current software version.

-   Automate documentation generation where possible (e.g., OpenAPI
    specs).

-   Follow Conventional Commits for clear version control.
