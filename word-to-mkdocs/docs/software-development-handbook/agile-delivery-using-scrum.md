# Agile delivery using Scrum

We have adopted Scrum, having used a mix of project management
approaches. Scrum replaces traditional staged development with Sprints
and Scrum events.

!!! note "**Sprint**"
    A fixed-length period to **complete** small increments of working software.

Manage each *Sprint* with these *Scrum* events:

!!! note "**Planning**"
    - Decide what work needs to be done.

!!! note "**Daily Scrum**"
    - Review progress and address impediments.

!!! note "**Review**"
    - Assess what has been achieved and gather feedback.

!!! note "**Ret rospective**"
    - Reflect on the *Sprint* discuss areas for improvement.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    Continually refine requirements to make planning meetings easier!

## Cross-functional Scrum Teams

*Scrum* replaces technical silos with cross-functional teams. It
identifies 3 roles --

!!! note "**Product Owner**"
    - Represents stakeholders and users.

    - Defines, prioritises and refines backlog items.

    - Works with the team to negotiate work during *Sprint* planning.

    - Often a *Clinician* but can also be a *Product Specialist* or *Business Analyst.*

!!! note "**Scrum Master**"
    - Coaches and supports the *Scrum* team, helping them improve processes.

    - Facilitates *Scrum* events and removes impediments.

    - Often a *Software developer but can be anyone with strong facilitation and coaching skills.*

!!! note "**Scrum Team**"
    - Collaborates to negotiate work at *Sprint* planning.

    - Delivers the work, ensuring it meets the acceptance criteria.

    - Includes everyone needed to create the product

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    *Scrum* is reliant on having people committed to carrying out its 3 key roles!

## Agile practices for requirements gathering

Scrum teams capture requirements in *User Stories*. But in some cases, a
formal Software *Requirements Specification* may still be necessary.

!!! note "**User Story**"
    A brief description of a need, told from a user's perspective. With acceptance criteria written in Gherkin syntax to define 'done.'

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    - Ensure everyone understands the work involved.

    - Consider hidden tasks to manage *technical debt.*

    - Share common criteria in a *Definition of Done,* published to your Kanban board.

## Agile planning with Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps supports agile planning from backlog management to sprint
execution:

!!! note "**Agile process template**"
    Provides essential work items like User Stories, Tasks, Bugs, and Test Scripts to support your agile workflow.

!!! note "**Boards**"
    **Kanban boards:** Visualise and manage requirements across all stages, independent of sprint cycles. > **Task Boards**: Track the status of tasks and their progress during sprints.

!!! note "* *Dashboard**"
    Create customised dashboards to track key metrics such as test results, build quality, code coverage, and sprint burndown. This helps you monitor overall project health and progress.
