# User interface and accessibility standards

Software **SHOULD** be intuitive and accessible. Design decisions must
prioritise safety and accessibility. Keep in mind the following
principles:

!!! note "** User-Centred Design**"
    Engage end-users early and often to understand their needs. Design interfaces that align with their tasks.

!!! note "**Acc essibility**"
    Adhere to WCAG 2. Level AA standards at a minimum. Ensure all features are accessible to users with disabilities, including compatibility with assistive technologies.

!!! note "**C onsistency**"
    Provide a consistent user experience across DHCW applications. > Follow the Single Record Product's UI Standard for internal clinical applications and the NHS Design System for public-facing services.
