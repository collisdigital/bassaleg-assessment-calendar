# Provide a build folder (./\<*rootfoldername\>/*build)

You **SHOULD** store the latest output from publish commands, though not
necessarily each build event, in a build folder.

Place your outputs in sub folders, named appropriately, with a suffix to
indicate output type and a prefix for the solution name. And take care
to indicate the last build date.
