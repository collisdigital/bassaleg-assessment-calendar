# Create a *root* folder for your solution (./\<rootfoldername\>)

You **SHOULD** place your solution file in a root folder. Doing so makes
it easy for others to clone a repo and open the file to get started. The
rest of the software project lives within this root folder.

Provide a sensible name, using the name of the git repo or the solution
file.

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    If the RootFolderName does not describe the project, replace it with something more accurate and understandable.

    Do this before you commit to source control. In doing so you avoid the need for communicating a change and making source control work overtime after the initial commit.
