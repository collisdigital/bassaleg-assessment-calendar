# Provide a test folder (.*/\<rootfoldername\>/*specs*/*test)

As the name suggests, this is where you **SHOULD** store your tests. As
with the *src* folder, you **SHOULD** place test projects in sub
folders, mapping the name of the sub folder to the name of the project.

Names **SHOULD** correspond to those of your dependency layers, with the
*.Tests* suffix added.

When writing the tests, you **SHOULD:-**

-   Prioritise output testing over testing that assures modules.

-   Adopt Behavioural Driven Development as your approach.

-   Balance the benefits and drawbacks of adding extensive testing to
    your solution.

-   Consider You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) rules when deciding what
    to test.

-   Consider the testing requirements described in your Definition of
    Done (DOD).
