# Provide a scripts folder (.*/\<rootfoldername\>/*build/scripts)

You **SHOULD** store any scripts needed to assist with the build[^2], by
placing them in a '*scripts'* subfolder. This offers a standard location
for any others wishing to build your solution.

As well as build scripts, use the folder to store artefacts related to
your continuous integration \[CI\] processes. While some CI systems
require you place build artefacts in the root, placing other supporting
files in the scripts folder avoids excessive cluttering.

When storing scripts, you **SHOULD** keep your scripts clean and with
comments.

You **SHOULD** prefer using scripted solutions over build events
whenever possible.

**You **SHOULD** NOT** break published conventions without considering how
this impacts others.
