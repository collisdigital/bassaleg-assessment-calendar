# The need for guidance

Modern programming practices expect us to prove that our code meets
functional requirements and can be reliably built and deployed.

This requires a little forethought when creating a solution that others
will use (often without the originating developer present.) So, it's
critical we create software solutions that are:

-   Clear and explicit

-   Understandable by developers of all abilities

-   Safely extensible & well documented

The following sections provide guidance on how we can achieve this.
