# Provide a documents folder (.*/\<rootfoldername\>/*specs*/*docs)

You **SHOULD** keep documentation you consider valuable (including
diagrams, specifications[^1] and documents relevant to build output) in
a documents ('docs') folder. This is particularly useful if there's no
Solutions Architecture Design document \[SAD\] or Software Requirements
Specification \[SRS\].

While most documents **MAY** be stored in our document management
system, not all will reflect the current state of the solution. For
example, a SAD or SRS may include planned work or perhaps even obsolete
design decisions. Maintaining a *docs* folder is an important step in
addressing any drift between design and build.

You **SHOULD NOT** let documentation become stale or out-of-step with
the build output or use the docs folder as a replacement for the
corporate document management system.

    - Use automation. For example, generate .pdf files from the repo's markdown files and include OpenAPI documentation.

    - Take care when linking to other documents. Links are only relevant while they are maintained and may be resolvable only from within our domain.

    - Encourage testers and business analysts to use. feature files to record changes to requirements. Link your docs folder to those*. feature* files
