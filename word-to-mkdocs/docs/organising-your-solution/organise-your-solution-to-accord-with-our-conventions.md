# Organise your solution to accord with our conventions

You **SHOULD** organise your solution according to our standards. They
follow those used by many language ecosystems, including the .NET source
code itself. Note that they differ from the typical Visual Studio *File
New* defaults.

There are two choices, as shown below. This document describes the
first, which suits a Behavioural Driven Development \[BDD\] approach.
But they are very similar and equally valid.

!!! example "Examples of good practice"
    └──{*RootFolderName*}/ \# Root folder for your entire software solution

    ├── deploy/ \# Any infrastructure provisioning scripts

    ├── build/ \# Any published build outputs

    │ └── scripts/ \# Build scripts and CI scripts not required in the root

    ├── examples/ \# Samples and demos on how to build or consume your app

    ├── specs/ \# Container folder for tests and documentation

    │ ├── docs/ \# Diagrams, specifications and documentation

    │ └── test/ \# Automated tests and feature files

    ├── src/ \# Source code separated by dependency layer subfolders

    ├── README.md \# Starting point for anyone building or using your software

    ├── .editorconfig \# Enforces a consistent coding style for your project

    └── {*SolutionName}*.sln \# Solution file

    Organizing your software solution - option #1 (suits a BDD approach)

    └──{*RootFolderName*}/ \# Root folder for your entire software solution

    ├── build/ \# Any published build outputs

    │ └── scripts/ \# Build scripts and CI scripts not required in the root

    ├── docs/ \# Diagrams, specifications and documentation

    ├── README.md \# Starting point for anyone building or using your software

    ├── .editorconfig \# Enforces a consistent coding style for your project

    └── {*SolutionName}*.sln \# Solution file

    Organizing your software project - option #2

!!! tip "Practical tips"
    - Use the approach that best matches your needs

    - In later versions of .NET use C:\\\> dotnet new gitignore to generate a .gitignore file

    - Clone our example project structure from the Software Development Standards project in Azure DevOps.
