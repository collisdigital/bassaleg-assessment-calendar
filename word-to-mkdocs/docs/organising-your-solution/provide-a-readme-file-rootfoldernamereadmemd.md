# Provide a readme file (,/\<rootfoldername\>/readme.md)

You **SHOULD** provide a README file in the root folder as a common way
of helping others learn about your software.

As a minimum, it **SHOULD** instruct others on how to build and deploy
your software. Typically, you **SHOULD** also include guidelines on how
to contribute to your project -- how to fix bugs or correct typos, for
example.

    Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/style-guide/welcome/) to maintain a consistent and familiar style

    - Using Markdown makes it easier to format text and include links & images

    - Describe your assurance processes (such as code reviews or gated check-ins) in a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file, saved to the root folder

    - Consider your audience. What would others find useful?
