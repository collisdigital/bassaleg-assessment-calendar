# Create a specification folder (./\<rootfoldername\>/specs)

You **SHOULD** store test projects and any specifications you consider
valuable in a specification ('specs') folder. Keeping them together
helps link your documentation to tests.

You **SHOULD** clearly indicate the expected behaviours, functionality
and actual integration with consumers of the code. This may include data
extracts from other systems or software.
