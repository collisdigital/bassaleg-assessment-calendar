# Use existing conventions for project types

Some project types require you to work with a different convention.
Typically, these include web projects, MVC, web forms, APIs, or razor
pages. For example, MVC structures projects for path conventions,
whereas razor pages use folder hierarchy.

However, the project type determines this - not the software team. And
you **SHOULD** follow the namespace convention described above for any
additional folders you add to these project types.
