# Provide an examples folder (./\<*rootfoldername\>/*examples)

It is **RECOMMENDED** that you provide examples to show others how to
use your published outputs. Developers will thank you for it!

SQL outputs, scripted languages, or configurations such as yaml, will
likely be single files. For complex outputs, store each demo project in
its own sub-folder.

When doing so you **SHOULD:**

-   Make sure examples work as expected.

-   Demonstrate typical use cases, capabilities and support queries.

-   Consider using automation for each example output.

You **SHOULD NOT** let examples become stale and out-of-date.
