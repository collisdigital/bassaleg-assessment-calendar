# Provide a deploy folder (./\<*rootfoldername\>/*deploy)

You **SHOULD** store any infrastructure provisioning scripts in a deploy
folder. These could be Azure Resource Management (ARM) templates or
Bicep scripts and associated parameter files, but it is **RECOMMENDED**
that you use Terraform scripts.
