# Characteristics of a good test summary report

A Test Summary Report **SHOULD** have the following characteristics: -

| **SHORT:** | As a rule of thumb, aim for no more than 8 -- 11 pages. |
| --- | --- |
| **CLEAR:** | Information should be clear. Read DHCW's [writing checklist](https://nhswales365.sharepoint.com/sites/DHCW-Intranet/SitePages/Writing-style-guide.aspx) for tips. |
| **PRECISE:** | The information, though concise, should not be abstract as this will not help the reader draw clear conclusions from it. |
| **CONSISTENT:** | While content will differ, each report **SHOULD** use the same template. |

The remainder of this guide provides rules for drafting a report, using
the template.
