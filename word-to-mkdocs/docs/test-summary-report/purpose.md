# Purpose

A Test Summary Report tells readers whether your software needs
corrective action, can proceed to the next stage or is ready for
release. So it **SHOULD** provide a clear summary of the test process,
results, and key metrics.

This document instructs you on how to write a Test Summary Report. It is
guided by the ISO 29119-3:2013[^1] standard for writing a Test
Completion Report, although the headings used in the Test Summary Report
template vary.

When you are ready to start, base your report on the SDS-TEM-5 Test
Summary Report template.
