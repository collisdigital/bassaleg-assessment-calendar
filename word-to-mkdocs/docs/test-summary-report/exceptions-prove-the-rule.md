# Exceptions prove the rule

While this Test Summary Report template is designed to be suitable for
most situations, there may be cases where altering the format is
necessary and justifiable. These changes should be made only when they
add significant value for the reader.

However, it is important to maintain the integrity of the template, and
changes **SHOULD NOT** be made casually.
