# When to create a test summary report

You **SHOULD** draft a report at the end of a project, but you **MAY**
do so for the end of each testing cycle.  Typically, it will be written
for any new service, major change or new developments in existing
services, releases, procurements, proof of concepts and innovation
products[^2].
