# Layout and formatting

For brevity, formatting rules such as, font, line spacing & paragraph
settings, headers and footers are omitted. You **SHOULD** keep to those
used in the blank template.

if you need to insert document references in the footer you **MAY**
remove the footer image to ensure the text is clearly visible.

You **SHOULD** strive to ensure the report displays well in Microsoft
Word on desktop and online.
